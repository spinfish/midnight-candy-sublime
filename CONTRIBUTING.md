## Contributing to midnight candy
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to midnight candy!
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project.
These are mostly guidelines, not hard rules, and you may propose changes to them in a pull request if you wish.

### I don't want to read all this, I only want to ask a question!!

> **Note:** Please avoid filing an issue to ask a question.
It most likely doesn't belong here unless it provides value to a larger audience.

If you have questions about the theme, feel free to contact me via Discord at `mackenzie#0173`.
I am pretty active on there most of the time and *should* be able to get back to you fairly quickly.

### Good Bug Reports

Please try to stick to the following guidelines when submitting bug reports:

1. **Do not open duplicate issues.** *Please* search your issue to make sure it has not already been asked. Duplicate issues will be closed.
2. **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to help identify the problem.
3. **Describe the exact steps that reproduce the problem** with as many details as possible and be specific, e.g. if it is an issue of something not being themed properly, provide a screenshot or code snippet (using Markdown), the type of file (e.g. Python, JavaScript) used, and what you expected it to look like.

Insufficient information on an issue or lack of response upon asking for it will lead to it being closed.

### Submitting a pull request

There aren't many things to worry about here, just make sure it only focuses on a single aspect (one huge PR is harder to deal with than several smaller, more managable ones) and matches the format found in the rest of the project.

#### Commit guidelines

- Use present tense (e.g. "Fix class" not "Fixed class")
- Limit the message to 72 characters (preferably less)
- When referencing issues, use the shorthand `#123` and place it at the end of the commit message
- Use proper grammar and spelling
